Curious, Creative, Tenacious(requires hopefulness)

**********Gameplay idea:
You are a space alien captured by the CIA locked up in Area 51 waiting to be dissected for further
studies. Luckily, you have been probed with a tracker that has led your alien brethren to your
exact location to rescue you from your doom. The evacuation UFO is waiting at an extremely high 
50,000 feet in the sky! Fortunatly, your species is capable of having extreme adrenaline in times of
stress and can jump at a rate of 100 feet per second! YOUR MISSION: The invasion of your comrades has torn
up what remains of the desert compound you were being held captive inside of. You must jump on the
floating pieces of stone-like ground that the evacuation UFO is levitating to reach your exit. BE AWARE:
the floating compounds are only a side-effect of the UFO's anti-gravity engines above your position.
the platforms will disintegrate after you pass them by, so watch your step!! Also, your alien friends have
deployed counter-measure drones to prevent the humans from shooting you down, but they are ONLY programmed
to destroy everything they see and are extremely dangerous when in direct contact. You can use their
propeller-like blades on the top of their heads to jump much higher and faster, but avoid their 
path as best you can if you hope to survive!

**********Cosmetics
Hero images: Red bullet-alien skin
Platforms: Grey Cracked Desert-stone platforms (randomly generated)
Enemies: Yellow heli-drones 
Extra features / images: moving clouds, cacti plants, jumper-boosts, and coin power ups.


**********Bugs
The more motion that is added, the game will sometimes lag or freeze after playing for awhile. 
Character may at times seem to freeze in place or appear to shake rapidly out of control.
The space bar for jumping may be falty at times. Do not go crazy with it!


**********Gameplay fixes
Coordinate movements have been replaced with more suitible variables to ensure that the character 
remains in perfect condition.
Running and jumping speeds have been patched to run more suitibly with the amount of motion that
the game is containing while playing. This should prevent the game from freezing up or 
lagging midway through...

**********Features
Varied powerups: 
jumper-boosts that can accelarate the jumping distance and speeds 1,000 fold. 
Coins can be collected to increase the player score to get them to their goal much quicker.
Jumping on drone propellers that act the same as jumper-boosts

I really enjoyed this class. I learned so much from my friends and teacher! I look forward
to doing this as a job or major in college. I will miss the fun I had in 6th period!
